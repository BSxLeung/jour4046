,Inspiring and Hilarious,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5133978/?ref_=tt_urv,"This movie was as enjoyable for a 3 year old as it was for a 63 year old. Abominable takes the themes of grief, hope and family and magically transforms them to take the viewers on an epic journey through Chinese culture. Infused with music, language, landmarks, customs, spirituality and traditions, Abominable makes viewers feel like they are on the journey right alongside Everest and his newfound friends.
With a slew of witty one liners, heartfelt moments and magic-infused hilarity, this film plays like a Concerto of a young girl trying to help a lost creature find his way home, and in turn, finding her own way back home as well. Fresh and original, absolutely one of the best animated films of the decade.",21-Sep-19,lindsayriessen,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur63489036/?ref_=tt_urv,10る10ら,1

,A Wonderful Animated Film,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5112534/?ref_=tt_urv,"Dreamworks has been hit or miss when it comes to releasing great animated films over the years. Whether it's Shrek or Kung Fu Panda, there some truly great movies out there, but I once How to Train Your Dragon hit theatres, and each of its consecutively great sequels, I found myself wondering if the studio had peaked with that trilogy. Well, Abominable is their latest upcoming release, and after seeing it at the Toronto International Film Festival, I can confidently say that this is surprisingly one of the very best animated films that they have released, ever.
Everyone knows that the creature known as the Yeti has been known to be a myth, but in Abominable, a young girl (Yi) finds that one actually exists. Having been experimented on in laboratories until escaping and finding its way onto this girl's roof, she befriends him and makes it her mission, along with two other friends, to return him to his home on mount Everest. This particular story has been told hundreds of times, but unlike many movies that choose to copy and paste formulas, Abominable is one that truly cares about the characters and the adventure they go on, which had me falling in love with it as it progressed.
Having written the story for Monster's Inc., worked in the animation department at Pixar on Toy Story and Toy Story 2, eventually directing her first animated feature in Open Season, and now officially writing and directing Abominable, completely bringing her full vision to life, Jill Culton is one with a storied career, albeit not massive. After her outing here, I must admit that I will be following her work for years to come because I believe her vision and how it was showcased, was honestly fantastic. On top of that, Dreamworks has been on a roll with incredible animation, and this movie is nothing shy of fitting that description.
It should go without saying nowadays that most films released by large studios will probably hire the best of the best to create the most beautiful animation, but I just have to commend them here as well. The smooth motions of characters and the detail put into the wide landscape shots are all superb, and these elements are only elevated by a very enjoyable cast of characters, on an adventure that eventually had me in tears. If for nothing else, you'll probably enjoy looking at this movie, but it has much more than that to offer.
In the end, Abominable does suffer from feeling familiar at first glance, but this movie embraces that and creates a journey that feels fresh. The themes throughout this film are meant for all ages, which is why I believe this movie will be a hit with families across the world when it hits theatres. I wasn't exactly jumping out of my seat with excitement when the trailers for this movie first began to circulate, but after experiencing it for myself, I must say that Abominable definitely surprised me in ways that I wasn't expecting. This is a great animated film and it deserves attention when it hits theatres.",10-Sep-19,kjproulx,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23240045/?ref_=tt_urv,10る9ら,1
,Hollow,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5192907/?ref_=tt_urv,This movie had no more substance than its admittedly appealing visuals. The story is as unoriginal as it comes.

,A Film with a BIG Heart,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5112946/?ref_=tt_urv,"Abominable is a gorgeously animated film that should delight all children (and a lot of adults) with its stunning animation, original storyline and heartfelt messaging.
All aspects of the animation process are seamlessly meshed in this film, and the end result is an extraordinary animated feature. A pleasing storyline, great character designs including the lovable ""Everest"", visually mesmerizing backgrounds and skillful cinematography, ensure that this film should delight most audiences, of all ages.
All the sequences be they, the skyscrapers of urban Shanghai, or the rivers and mountains of rural China, are breathtaking beautiful and intrinsically detailed. The film is a delight to watch. I found it charming and visually pleasing on so many fronts. The musical score is a perfect accompaniment to the animation. It is patently obvious that this project is close to the Writer and Director, Jill Culton's heart.",10-Sep-19,ZimKit,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29309308/?ref_=tt_urv,10る9ら,1

The movie lacks creativity, is full of cliche and formula storyline, and is generally a waste of time.
I went into the movie with medium expectations, came out disappointed with the movie.

,Endearing.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5154030/?ref_=tt_urv,"Abominable tells the story of Yi(Chloe Bennet). Yi finds a Yeti on her roof and goes on an adventure to return the Yeti, to his family.
Abominable is a fantastic film. Writer-director Jill Culton has given us a movie, with plenty of adventure set pieces, hilarious, heartwarming & emotional scenes, all rolled into one. The animation is gorgeous. The 3D further engrosses you, in the proceedings of the movie. The Yeti is absolutely adorable. The voice-over work is unforgettable. Chloe Bennet is spectacular as Yi. Albert Tsai is brilliant as Peng. Tenzing Norgay Trainor is awesome as Jin. Joseph Izzo is outstanding as Everest. Eddie Izzard is awesome as Burnish. Sarah Paulson is excellent as Dr. Zara. Tsai Chin & Michelle Wong are superb as Nai Nai & Yi's Mom, respectively. The supporting cast is great. Abominable is a must watch, with your entire family.

,Great Animated Film From Pearl,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5146959/?ref_=tt_urv,"As a fan of anime, this is an amazingly looking film from an Chinese company. Obviously DreamWorks distributed it, but this is an great start for the studio.
When I saw the trailer attached to the 'live-action' Dumbo remake and had no interest in seeing it. But I went to watch it with a group of friends, and we really liked it. I tend to disagree with some things my friends would say, although I will say this: it is a better looking DreamWorks film since, How To Train Your Dragon. If Pixar has gotten better with CGI, than this proves that DreamWorks can improve on their art. Whether it's made to look cartoony or realistic, this studio will still make some good material with great messages for kids. Even if some are hit and mess.
If you are Asian, or not (not being racist) this a recommendation for all.
P.S. when I say an anime, I mean it looks right out of a Miyazaki film.",28-Sep-19,swansondrew,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur100206449/?ref_=tt_urv,10る9ら,1

,Best DreamWorks Animation Movie Yet-i!!!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5167791/?ref_=tt_urv,"I saw DreamWorks's next big movie, Abominable at AMC Palisades 21 with my mom. It was the third animated film to feature a yeti after Smallfoot and Missing Link. My favorite part of the movie is when Yi is playing with her magic violin to do magic with Everest the Yeti, The funniest parts of the movie is when Peng plays with Everest and Jin running around. I laughed at these parts! And the most emotional parts are when Yi plays the magic violin when they made it to Beijing and the kids saying goodbye to Everest. It was so sad I cried for a bit.
So, Please go see that movie! It's so great and emotional! And don't let the yeti come to your house! I give this movie 10.8/10.9.",6-Oct-19,nickysofficialchannel,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur99602830/?ref_=tt_urv,10る10ら,1

,I have to admit that Abominable certainly shocked me in ways I didn't expect.,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5163729/?ref_=tt_urv,"When it comes to releasing great animated movies over the years, Dreamworks is hit and missed. Whether it's Shrek or Kung Fu Panda, there are some really great movies out there, but I once hit theaters How to Train Your Dragon, and each of its consecutively excellent sequels, I found myself wondering if that series peaked the studio. Okay, their latest release is Abominable, and after seeing it at the Toronto International Film Festival, I can confidently say that this is shockingly one of the best animated movies they've ever produced.Everybody assumes that the beast known as the Yeti is believed to be a legend, but a young girl (Yi) discovers in Abominable that one actually exists. She's been studying in laboratories until she escapes and finds her way to the roof of this man, and she makes friends with him and makes it her mission to return him to his home on Mount Everest along with two other colleagues. Hundreds of times this particular story has been told, but unlike many films that choose to copy and paste formulas, Abominable is one that genuinely cares about the characters and the journey they're going on, which made me fall in love with it as it progressed.Having written the story for Monster's Inc., worked on Toy Story and Toy Story 2 in the animation department at Pixar, finally directing her first animated feature in Open Season, and now officially writing and directing Abominable, bringing her complete vision to life, Jill Culton is one with a storied, though not huge, career. I have to confess that I'm going to follow her work for years to come after her outing here because I believe her dream and how it was presented were genuinely awesome. In fact, Dreamworks was on a roll with outstanding animation, and this film is nothing short of matching that definition.Nowadays, it should go without saying that most of the films released by major studios are likely to hire the best of the best to make the most stunning animation, but I just have to applaud them here. The smooth movements of characters and the details put into the wide shots of the scenery are all excellent, and these elements are only enhanced by a very fun cast of characters on an adventure that finally takes me home. If you're going to enjoy watching this movie for nothing else, but it has much more to say than that. Overall, at first sight, Abominable suffers from a familiar feeling, but this movie embraces that and produces a journey that feels fresh.The themes are meant for all ages throughout this movie, which is why I think this film will be a success with families all over the world when it hits theaters.

,Dreamworks Abominable Film Review - Directors Jill Culton & Todd Wilderman Find Home With Chloe Bennet And An Endearing Baby Yeti,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5233120/?ref_=tt_urv,"When a baby yeti escapes a research site, the owner, Eddie Izzard's Dr Burnish and his minions, are not far behind. Dreamworks and China's Pearl Studio set the Abominable action in Shanghai where our adorable yeti lands on young Yi's roof. Chloe Bennet of Marvel Agents Of Shield, (so we had to watch her big screen debut), voices the surprised teenager and hides him when the helicopters are circling overhead. Feeding him with grandma Tsai Chin's pork balls, (mmm they looked delicious), she manages to understand he is from Mount Everest, through a distant billboard. So names the cute fluffy baby Everest. And he's a playful puppy with strokeable fur, big beseeching blue eyes and milk teeth!
Directors Jill Culton & Todd Wilderman create a magical being who just wants to go home. Something that Yi hasn't had since her dad died. Her Mum voiced by Michelle Wong and Gran are doing everything right, but Yi keeps herself busy so that she doesn't have to spend time with them. She even plays her dad's violin on the roof away from them. Dreaming of the trip through China that he had planned for them before he died. Everything she earns goes towards it. While she tries to avoid her social media obsessed cousin Jin, voiced by Tenzing Norgay Trainor, (the great climber was his grandad), and young neighbour Peng, voiced by Albert Tsai.
When Jin and Peng also meet Everest one night on the roof, the resulting police call sets Sarah Paulson's zoologist Dr Zara on the trail. Her job was to find a yeti, and restore the reputation of Dr Burnish. And now she has to catch him all over again. She's not a Disney Princess! But taking flight, the frightened Everest, with Yi attached, has just made it a lot harder. With Yi intent on getting Everest home, and chasing after them the reluctant Jin, and excited Peng, who eventually catch up with the cargo ship they are leaving on. The Shanghai scenes are touchingly full of humour. And then we're off on their adventure to the Himalayas with Everest's magical humming powers.
Such a beautiful film, the script written by Jill Culton, who also co-produced, explores Chinese culture as much as it animates the journey. And there's a lot to discover.
The animators have designed an incredible world beyond the city. Everest can harness the beauty of nature and makes the journey even more magical. Whether it's flower wave riding, making giant blueberries grow, flying giant dandelion puffballs and even flying cloud fish. And when Yi plays her violin she discovers her own magic, and a familiar journey she never expected. But for Everest and Yi there really is no place like home.
During the end credits the story develops but no gerbils were eaten! A perfect film for kids that has a great musical score and beautifully paints the colours of China.",3-Nov-19,helenbassett,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur101877629/?ref_=tt_urv,10る10ら,1

,Cute Movie,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5213806/?ref_=tt_urv,"Abominable Review:
Abominable is the story of three teenagers as they help a Yeti return to his family while avoiding a wealthy man and a zoologist who want it for their own needs. The trailer for this looked just adorable to me when I saw it. The story to me seemed as if it would be pretty touching and just overall enjoyable. Based on the trailer I was exactly right. I found myself enjoying Abominable. As an overall story I think it worked for most of the duration of the movie. A teenage girl, Yi, finds a Yeti on her roof and with discovering him, she finds out stuff about herself. I loved the incorporation of Yi's violin playing. The animation was actually correct on home one should play. Like in some animated movies they'll have people play instruments similar to how they're played, but not exactly. The vibrato, bow hold, and everything was correct. Later there's a cool thing with the violin where the animation was beautiful. The animation was pretty good in this. The backgrounds were simplified, sort of like a comic, and the characters had more detail, but not a lot. Some parts I think needed some work with the animation. To continue on with the story, it was still enjoyable. Predictable, but that's to be expected. Dreamworks made one of the best animated films of all time, How to Train Your Dragon. Abominable has similarities to that film and I could help but see parallels throughout. Basically what I'm saying is it's not the most original idea. I liked the family aspect of the movie. The three main characters are all related and there's just some family stuff to it that worked for me. One of the three, Peng, had a very annoying voice. It's not his fault but wow did that get annoying after a long time. Overall I think this is just an enjoyable movie. It may be because I saw this a week ago or this is all I got out of the movie, but this is a shorter review. I'd recommend this movie. I could probably see this being nominated in the awards season just because this one had messages throughout and critics did like it.

,"Can't go wrong, play it safe vibe yet stimulating",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5137228/?ref_=tt_urv,"I went to see this with my 4 year old daughter, at my suggestion, and have no regrets whatsoever. It ticks all the boxes, plays all the right heart strings at the right moments, so while it's very uplifting you could be forgiven for thinking it was overly formulaic, because it is.
However, it works well, uplifting score mingled in with teases of coldplay and other various feelgood tripe suits the scenes well and leaves you walking away with a sense of satisfaction.
I really appreciated the way they tackled the bereavement angle, no spoilers, but they made Yi really validate herself to her late father in her own way that didn't overshadow or even interfere with the main quest she had been given. The other characters, while well purposed were inconsequential to the main plot, but plenty of laughs and a few genuine emotional moments made this film well worth a look.

,Another Great DreamWorks film!,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5186277/?ref_=tt_urv,"That's right, DreamWorks is back with another animated film this year, the first being How to Train Your Dragon: the Hidden World, this time they are partnered with Pearl Animation, it is directed by Jill Culton and has been genuinely positive in terms of reviews and ratings, as expected the US got the film released before us, just like Smallfoot.., which is strange because they are both about yetis and they were released near each other, in both the US and UK..., how odd, anyways!, the trailers for the film looked cute and it has potential, otherwise it would look like a bland looking version of Smallfoot, it was released on the 12th of October in the UK and I manage to watch the film the day after that, so basically I saw it yesterday and.... I really liked it!, it's not perfect of course, so let's talk about it.
Yi is a teenager who is always busy and never has time for her family, especially after her Dad passed away, she has always played his violin that always calm Yi down and has always been a part of her life, however she discovers that there is a yeti on her roof, one that has escaped from a lab that belongs to a billionaire who wants the yeti captured, however Yi releases that this yeti is magical and must return him to the Himalayas, Everest, which is what she names the yeti, she is accompanied by Jin and his cousin Peng who join her on their journey to take Everest back to where he belongs, we have seen this plot plenty of times before about a character trying to take this creature back to where it belongs without getting caught by anyone, this has been done in How to Train Your Dragon, Iron Giant and so much more, you know what's going to happen and it'll eventually get a happy ending, which makes this plot very predicable from top to bottom, not only that but the humour is a bit hit and miss, using the lowest form of comedy like burping and bottom jokes, the script is also just using generic lines that we have heard so many times before, however despite all that, this film is still worth a while, it has a plot that we have seen before, but at least it has heart to it and it has a nice story that is decently well executed, along with nice touching scenes and half-way funny comedy also, atleast Culton and the writers care about what they are making, even if it's been done to death so many times, It also has a nice message about spending more time with your family then always being constantly busy, so all in all, it's a mixed bag, pros: it has a decent story with good heart, nice message and mostly funny comedy, cons: it's a very predicable yet generic plot with toilet humour that is still not all that funny, but at the very least the director and writers care about the film they are making.
The animation is very beautiful as always, DreamWorks always put effort in their animation, but here with Pearl, it still looks strong... for the most part, the backgrounds look stunning and beautiful, the character design and animation looks well done, Everest looks so adorable also, when it comes to Everest using his magic, the film gets very creative and colourful also, so overall, it looks amazing, it still has that DreamWorks touch to it along with some help from Pearl also, however despite how much effort has been put in, there are still a few things that may need to put better detail to, the character designs are nice for the most part, but they look pretty bland and basic, looks like something that belongs in a Netflix film or something, nothing wrong with their designs, they look too average and basic for my viewing, the rendering also feels a bit like a Netflix film also, it doesn't really have that DreamWorks quality to it, but besides that, the animation is truly a stunning and visually spectacular view to behold.
The characters are surprisingly likeable and not annoying, well most of them anyways, Yi may seem like a teenager with a dead parent issue, but she is a very endearing, likeable, funny and relatable main character, you do feel for her and her loss, I really enjoyed her throughout the film, Everest is easily the best character in the film, he is funny, adorable, entertaining and his whole character and what he can do is very interesting, easily my favourite character in this film with Yi second, Mr. Burnish (Eddie Izzard) is also pretty entertaining and there is also more to him then just some villain, Dr. Zara (Sarah Paulson) is also a very entertaining character and just like Mr. Burnish, there is a little more to her then what she already is, which in this case is pretty obvious, Jin is okay, he never did that much for me, he did start off as a bit unlikeable and is the ""one who likes social media and his looks then other people"" type of character which always annoys, but he was pleasant and likeable enough to make me care about him, Peng is Jin's cousin who is the comic relief, he was the weakest character here, he was somewhat annoying and since he is a overweight character, there was a few jokes of him eating, however his friendship with Everest is actually quite strong and I did enjoy that part of Peng when he's not trying to be funny, the voice acting is pretty good coming from everyone, Chloe Bennet is really great as Yi, getting into character and sounding very convincing as a voice actress, same can be said with Albert Tsai as Peng, Tenzing Norgay Trainor as Jin and Joseph Izzo as Everest, however I was really surprised by Eddie Izzard and Sarah Paulson as Mr. Burnish and Dr. Zara, both were entertaining in their performances and both fitted their characters very well, so they both had the best acting in the film, with characters that can carry a film with strong performances likability and good comedy, it shows that they will be very memorable..... for the most part.
I would also like to mention the score by Rupert-Gregson Williams is amazing as always, so lovely to listen to, along with a decent song from Bebe Rexha called ""Beautiful Life"".
Well DreamWorks...., I'm glad you are still going strong, you may of made some rubbish, but I'm glad you are still making films, Abominable is another strong enjoyable and heartfelt film from the company, with it's decently well told story, good comedy, stunning animation, memorable characters, great voice acting and wonderful music, however it is pretty basic and predicable in terms of plot and humour, while stunning, it can look a bit Netflix-y and Peng wasn't very funny, however despite all that, it is still a great film and I do recommend it to DreamWorks fans, families and kids also, I do prefer Smallfoot over this, but I did really enjoy this film a lot and while it may not be amazing as some of DreamWorks' other films, it is certainly then like Trolls, Boss Baby, Home and all that, oh and speaking of Trolls......, that's the next DreamWorks film that'll be coming out early 2020........ hooooooooraaaaaay....

overall rating 97/100
Abominable is based on a hard working girl called Yi ( Chloe Bennet) who is distant from her family due to the death of her father which gave her passion of the violin to her. When she discovers a yeti on her roof she must embark on the journey of a lifetime bringing the yeti back to wear it belongs at everest but they must try and do this whilst trying to get away from people who want to put the yeti on the display to the public. Wow Abominable is one of the best animated movies i have ever seen it was truly remarkable and incredible lets talk about why this is.
First of all i have to start of with the jaw dropping animation. Wow this is easily some of the best animation i have ever seen. It really deserves a oscar nomination. As this films visuals were absolutely stunning. The imagery that they managed to create was so beautiful,imaginative and different to any other film. You could really just get lost in this amazing world that is presented to you within the film. My key highlights would be whenever everist got to show off his powers. The way his fur glowed light blue and the power over nature he had was just phenomenal to watch.
Next the film had a really good themes that could really make a lot of audience members connect and relate to the main character. Because Yis father had passed away she had become distant from her mother and grandma. I think this is how a lot of people grieve and the directors did a fantastic job at portraying this. And to see her character development and journey with making peace with her fathers death was just truly amazing and when she reconnected with her family at the end it was very sweet. And Yi as a main character was fantastic. She was funny and relatable. Someone good to look up to for younger kids as she was a hard worker as well who wouldn't stop until she got what she wanted.
Next the film had many heartwarming moments. The film as expected really pulled on your heartstrings as Yi struggles to let go and come to terms with her fathers death. There was some really beautiful moments in the film that nearly got me on a few occasions. The films soundtrack also definitely added emotional weight to these scenes. The use of coldplays fix you was perfect for the content being shown to us. Plus i thought the use of the violin was really beautiful in this film. Its such a lovely sounding instrument. And there was one particular scene when Yi was standing on a statue in the forest that just gave me goosebumps.
The only thing slightly negative i would say about it is that the film was formulaic. The film did have a very familiar formula that has been used in a fair amount of animated movies. A lost creature of monster needing to find his way home but people want to stop them from doing this did feel fairly reused from past plots of films. But the film has so many amazing moments that i almost forgot about it towards the end.
Now time for my final two positives. First of all the film was hilarious. The film had very good repeated humour that worked every time they used the joke which some films don't do well. But this was executed really well. And the interactions between everist and Yi and her friends were very funny and sweet to watch especially with Jin ( tenzing norgay trainor).
And finally the film had so many likeable and good characters. First of all we have to talk about everist or the abominable snowman. He bought a lot the humour and stunning visuals to life within the film and plus he was adorable to look at as well. And despite it being obvious it was going to happen it was still lovely to see everist reunited with his family at the end. Next Eddy Izzard pit a delightfully camp voice performance for the interesting character of Burnish. At first i thought he was not going to be a great villain. But i loved the character arc that was incorporated for his character as he came to the realisation that the abominable snowman needed to be protected not caught it was a great turning point in the film and for his character who became one of my favourites. But also Sarah paulson was fantastic as the villain Dr zara as well. She was a really great villain. And the director managed to fool me into thinking she was the good guy until it was revealed otherwise. And she was a ruthless villian who would stop at nothing to capture the abominable snowman. This led to some dramatic moments and entertaining action sequences.
Overall Abominable is one of the best animated films i have ever seen. And i am at awe at how far animation has come over the year.",17-Oct-19,rnixon-15663,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur101128147/?ref_=tt_urv,10る9ら,1

Abominable is a fun and action filled film. I enjoyed watching this movie. It wasn't perfect by any means but it was a good film. The things I liked was mainly, how it looked. Most of the scenes looked pretty real. All the things they visited were almost picture perfect. The only problem I had with the animation was sometimes the people would move a little blocky. Other wise the animation was spectacular. Another thing I liked was the comedy. They aimed towards adults and kids with the comedy. I loved that about this film. Also, they sold the story to me. I felt invested the whole time. The villain was a little week at some points but she didn't have to be spot on. The only there thing I didn't really like was how it was a little farfetched. Once you see the movie you will probably know what I was talking about.

,Terrific animation with a terrible story made by a 10 year old,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5149532/?ref_=tt_urv,"Abominable is justa meh movie to spend your time, and let the kids be amazed at the technical wonder going there. Yet, the film fails terribly to convey a sense of profundity in a story, it's basically mere technicism and cgi.
The music is often repetitive (although the beginning the instrumental music is surprisingly good), the mainstream philosophy of following your dreams doesn't need to be seen again, not again. The yeti guy was just too humane and mixed with the realism of the animation, seemed often creepy, like you need him to act like a wild animal just a little bit more. The story lacked imagination, it felt plain and boring, nothing new really.
The beginning looked like it could have had potential as a story for children to be amazed and adults to actually think and reflect on a profound topic, but every time any opportunity was building up for this, it became just too superficial for anything profound to happen, sometimes maybe too many jokes and dreamy scenes, yeah, we get it, but that's just too cloying.
Neither of the personages were developed enough more than just ""uhh I feel bad for a big yeti, uhh I feel bad for a broken violin, uhhh I have superpowers and I'm amazing, uhhh a big animal can magically sing""
In conclusion, I wouldn't bother with a movie with no real essence or core, that seemed that were just copying a Disney movie with a happy ending, and just adding beautiful effects to it.

This is an animated comedy aimed at the younger crowd but can be enjoyed by the older patrons that are along chaperoning. Chloe plays a young girl that has recently lost her father and lives with her mother and grandmother. She likes to go up on the roof and play her violin to unwind-it was her father's and it brings good memories to her. One night, she discovers a Yeti hiding out on her roof and comes to find out that he has escaped from a rich collector, played by Eddie, and he wants him back. Sarah is Eddie's underling in charge of keeping the Yeti under control-she isn't doing a good job of it. Chloe decides to help the Yeti get back home to the Himalayan mountains and goes on an adventure that will change her life. The Yeti has magical powers that it uses whenever they get into tight situations, mostly from being pursued by Eddie's men. It was an enjoyable watch and I wasn't bored at all. It's rated ""PG"" for action and some mild rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 37 minutes.

Yes, even I have stooped to that level; I'm only human. However, it's just plain untrue here. Not that Abominable is good; it's not. It exists in that boring land between bad and good, a supremely mediocre / middle-of-the-road animated kid's adventure that never tries hard enough to make an impact either positive or negative. In other words, it's a fairly standard DreamWorks Animation picture. You know the story: a child with family issues befriends a mythical creature, and through their adventures they learn better how to live their lives. Abominable has all the familiarities of the sub-genre, with an especially unabashed similarity to E.T., with the girl learning to say goodbye to her absent father through her new friend. Unlike that classic or other more successful child-monster friendship films, the central relationship is entirely too rushed, with our furry friend constantly displaying convenient powers and abilities, making the movie have neither intrigue nor stakes. The animation is unremarkable, the humor is predictable; it's all just plain basic. Even its positives are fairly passive. Some cool design elements here, a few cute jokes there, minor surprise character reveals. Notably, when the movie slows down and allows the main girl to just play her violin, there's a quiet elegance missing from the rest of the movie. I wish it leaned into that tone a little more, but in our modern cinematic world of loud noises and bright colors, Abominable desperately tries to standout and ironically gets lost in the crowd.",4-Oct-19,matthewssilverhammer,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19752191/?ref_=tt_urv,10る5ら,1
,"Tries hard, but doesn't quite get there",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5174076/?ref_=tt_urv,"I watched this with my 3 kids over the school holidays and it is certainly passable entertainment. Firstly, it looks good. The quality of animation is terrific though somehow it's not visually spectacular - technically proficient but lacking in imagination. It's a shame, a field trip trip through China should provide great visuals, but overall it was a bit dull to look at.
The main failing however is the script. The plot is OK and is a good premise, but all the dialogue is dull and predictable. It's not particularly witty or funny. I found the main character quite engaging, but the script lets down the emotional wallop it was trying to create. It's clearly aiming for something meaningful, like Coco, but packs nowhere near that level of emotional wallop.
Despite it failings, it is efficinet enough entertainment, the kids will enjoy it, but it could have been a lot more.",9-Oct-19,craigdoolan,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur67311095/?ref_=tt_urv,10る6ら,1

Abominable is another movie that you can predict the end yet you still want to watch every moment. The sceneries are simply amazing. Some of locations from the movie are now added to my travel list. The storyline is predictable but touching. (I did tried hard to hold my tears.) Also, as a person who has lived in China for years, I can see the hard work the team has put into the movie. Just so many vivid Chinese elements and details are included in this movie. I'm really glad that I actually went to see Abomiable. I went with my family. My grandma loved it, so am I as a teenager.

,A warm family adventure,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5141947/?ref_=tt_urv,"The somewhat recently by Universal Pictures acquired animation studio Dreamworks Animation, who we all know from box office and critical success franchises such as 'How To Train Your Dragon' and 'Shrek', is back with a new story that tries to win over young audiences with its cuteness-factor and older audiences with its more grown up message. But do these two work well together, in this collaboration with Shanghai-based production company Pearl Studio?
Abominable tells the story of a yeti, who has been captured by a wealthy explorer and his team of scientists. When the yeti breaks out of tycoon Burnish's (Eddie Izzard) secret laboratory, he ends up hiding on the roof of an apartment complex. Yi (Chloe Bennet) lives with her mother (Michelle Wong) and Nai Nai (Tsai Chin), but is barely home. She escapes the daily nagging of the women who put food on the table, by secretly walking neighbours dogs and taking out the trash of surrounding small businesses for a little bit of cash. Yi is saving for a trip around China, something she's always wanted to do with her father, until he passed away. When Yi comes home late at night, she usually escapes to her little lit up fort made out of blankets and crates, on the roof of the building she lives in. Here she finds comfort and solace, burying the noise of the busy streets of China, with the masterful melodic sounds of her violin. But this evening, she'll meet Everest the yeti (named after his home, Mount Everest), wounded and scared of everything human. It's up to Yi and her neighbours - cousins Peng (Albert Tsai) and Yin (Tenzing Norgay Trainor) - to help Everest cross China, through deserts and mountains, to find his way back home.
Dreamworks/Pearl Studio's newest vehicle has a bit of a slow start. The animation doesn't look too refreshing and some of the dialogue and voice work is a bit stiff. That's only because Dreamworks has made some great animated classics, and of course adults are going to compare. But are children doing the same? I think children will love the fluffy yeti, who acts like a child, because that's what he is. When we finally see Everest and the gang of kids escape the city to embark on an epic adventure, this is where the film won me over. The authentic scenery and magical tricks of Everest, make Abominable a film worth seeing.
The story tackles grief. Yi is clearly struggling with the death of her father, and the way she goes through some stages of it, is done in a very subtle and simple way, even the smallest of children can understand. It goes without saying, combined with the adorable yeti and a friendship that only becomes stronger, a few tears were shed in the second half of the film. A nighttime scene, in which our group of friends cuddle up under a by-fireflies-lit-up-tree, is one of the most wonderfully beautiful scenes I've seen in an animated film in a very long time.
Abominable slowly builds up, but becomes an unstoppable warm family adventure, that takes you on a dandelion flight through the mountains of Huang Shan and on a cloud coy fish ride over the Yunnan Province to fully captivate the magic of this grounded tale of grief and friendship.",25-Sep-19,eelen-seth,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur21869650/?ref_=tt_urv,10る7ら,1

The story structure is nothing new or particularly surprising. It has a lot of Asian actors which critics will undoubtedly enjoy for the sake of diversity. But ultimately apart from actually casting Asian voice actors it doesn't seem to really do anything more for China or Asian than the original Mulan.
Kids will certainly like this movie because they aren't as familiar with this repeated story structure as adults. Adults are unlikely to hate it, because it's wholesome, or find it to be a classic because it doesn't have many special components. It's hard to think of a more average and less risky-good or risky-bad family movie than this one.

,A very entertaining fantasy adventure,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5169126/?ref_=tt_urv,"The trailer for Abominable did not give away much, nor did it help in knowing what to expect.

It also features the voice talents of Eddie Izzard (a very sympathetic character), and Sarah Paulson as Dr. Zara (coincidence). It also features the grandson of Tenzing Norgay as Jin. Without the fun trivia mentioned, Abominable is an entertaining fantasy adventure. It has some emotional moments and humor. The story is like different set pieces where the character faces a unique challenge along the way. It is interesting that they have a strong female protagonist, where the male characters serve as comic relief, or a pretty face. Chloe Bennet's Yi (the heroine), and Tenzing Norgay Trainor's Jin have character arcs, though Trainor's seemed forced. There are no deep philosophical questions to ponder in the movie, just pure visual delight and escapism. With 3D, you can experience magic with the characters, as you travel across China to the Himalayas.

,"Noteworthy, familiar take on old premise.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5151867/?ref_=tt_urv,"Abominable, directed by Jill Culton, tells the story of a young Chinese girl, YI, who discovers a mythological creature, a magical yeti, who is hiding from... well, what else, people who want the yeti for their own gain.
Now, what makes Abominable noteworthy isn't the premise or ideology behind the story. However, a female director doing a film about under represented characters, (the family is Chinese), is a nice move by Dream Works. And it's not a bad movie, either.
Dreamworks for me, is a studio who often lobs and piggybacks off of Disney. For example, Pets isn't really that interesting of a movie and what I mean is, it lacks the heart of its predecessor, Zootopia, but to it's credit Pets actually made more at the box office. (Pets 2 was actually more ambitious but made a lot less money, but that's a topic for another day).
So let's get back to Abominable... Will you enjoy it? Yes. Will your kids enjoy it? Absolutely. Will your kids be asking for the sequel? I'm not sure.
Now is it an original movie? Absolutely not... You have to go back two thousand years of similar stories before you even get to E.T. But let's not be callous... Abominable wins in that the story itself doesn't carry much pretense about being much else. It executes in story and the Yeti being adorable. (Brace yourself for Sonic).
The Yeti himself, who Yi names Everest, is nice to look at and is able to carry out his basic function of propelling its characters to where they need to go. However, unlike E.T. he lacks his own trajectory and development. His magic becomes inexplicable.... Some other characters just don't quite work, others do.
That said, there is some genuine laughter here, decent plot twists, great CGI... While I skipped Little Foot this time last year, I managed to show up this time and wasn't disappointed.
In a summer of sub par Disney, (Toy Story 4 a 7, Lion King an 8) and I won't mention the the other two... Dream Works has started the fall with a whoop.",30-Sep-19,johnhandsome-32658,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur107595564/?ref_=tt_urv,10る7ら,1

,"Decent animated movie, deserves more attention",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5159781/?ref_=tt_urv,"Here we have ""Abominable"", one of the more talked-about animated films from 2019, but as it is not one of the big players by Pixar or Disney, it is probably still going a bit more under the radar. The writer and director here is Jill Culton, who has a long career in the industry. She worked as a story artist on the first two Toy Story movies over 20 years ago before being the original story writer for ""Monsters, Inc."" and another five years later, she was the one in charge of writing and directing ""Open Season"", another fairly well-known animated film. With follow-up work on this one when it comes to short films and a sequel, she still had a decent share of work, but still there was a surprisingly long gap between back then and now that she worked on this one here, over 10 years. But with the quality we got here, it is good she is back for this American/Chinese co-production. Now I am not sure which involvement surprises me more here. The characters are mostly Chinese, at least the good guys, the film takes place in China (not only for the Himalayas connection) and many voice actors are Chinese too. Still, there are Emmy winners Sarah Paulson and Eddie Izzard on board too, and also the nephew of Tenzing Norgay in one of the key roles, the sherpa who climbed up Mount Everest with Sir Edmund Hillary. Very fitting casting for sure given the film's plot. Said film's plot is about a young Chinese girl and her two friends who end up helping the (not so) Abominable Snowman to get back to his family at the Himalayas. This snowman was captured by a Western (of course) corporation who wants to present him to the world. But just briefly before they can, he manages to get out of his cell and find a way into the streets of the (unnamed) city. Okay there are some unrealistic factors here. I want to mention them at least, even if none of them are really negative deal breakers. The fact that there is the Abominable Snowman at the center of the film is alright, but really believing they let him out accidentally is something I struggle with. Also with the chaos he creates in the city, it is hard to believe that the police and press are simply not involved in this at all, no matter how big the corporation's money suitcases can be. And one specific scene about when the girl and the Abominable Snowman meet for the first time. She helps hide him by somewhat imprisoning him and it is after previous imprisonment difficult to believe the snowman deals with it so well the way he does when he accepts it and understands she is hiding him away from his suitors. Or also the initial villain's change in mind maybe wasn't the most realistic and as they still needed a villain, they gave that role to the woman who seemed so nice before that and we find out it was all just show. She cares about nothing but the money. By the way she looks like the evil grown-up version of the girl from Brave doesn't she? Actually, I can believe his transformation even easier as there was some progress in his thinking also with the tree he finds beautiful already, but is still at the point where pulling it out of the ground means nothing to him. But yeah, the revelation about her felt just for the sake of it really, like a bit of a poor man's version of the one from Zootopia or so. If the transformation of the boy who seems so posh and vain early on into an adventurer seems realistic, is something you need to decide subjectively. Or what to think of the mother and grandmother not doing anything at all apparently after the girl goes missing for quite a while. Or the idea that said girl is really managing to climb without proper equipment or training through one of the most dangerous areas of the planet. Sorry, but the explanation from her potential love interest that once she has set her mind on something, she won't give up till she succeeds is not enough there.
But now for the better aspects. First of all, it must be said, this is a really stunning film visually. Be it the lights of the city or all the utterly different kinds of beautiful landscapes China has to offer, they did nothing wrong here at all with the animation. The film is also entertaining. The character animation is just as good I would say and there isn't a single character in this slightly over 1.5-hour movie that looks shoddy or poorly animated. And it goes well together with the behavior of the characters that is also good enough for them to stay in the mind for long after the film is over. But back to the looks, there are two scenes that stay in the mind especially. The first would be the one when the trio (plus Abominable Snowman) leave the lights of the city. It was a bit haunting in a positive sense because the girl never left the city and it was something totally new to her. Well done, I felt her emotions. The second would be the more baity with the beautiful long scene of the three and the Yeti (that is what we call him here in Germany) on the feet of this really old rock statue. No need to go into detail, you know exactly which scene I mean in the second half of the film. Also kinda nice to see how he was used as a pillow with his soft fur. And they also brought something new to the Abominable Snowman general idea to the table that we have not seen in other films and there are sure many where he was used as part of the story. I am of course talking about his magic that he still isn't really capable of controlling as we found out during the pretty hilarious gigantic berry scene, but also later on near the snowy mountains when it is a fight for survival. I don't think this inclusion was really crucial or necessary, but I still liked it. I also thought the voice acting was good. I watched the German dub, so cannot say anything about the original, but we got some nice voice work here with very familiar-sounding voice actors for sure. The (initial) bad guy had the German voice of Tony Shalhoub in Monk and the central girl character's grandmother had another (to me) well-known voice that I did not manage to put a finger on though, maybe also because she does not have too much to say and vanishes completely once the journey really starts. I just said that there are several other Abominable Snowman movies and it is true. This is not even the only animated one from this year on this subject. I am talking about Warner Bros' ""Smallfoot"" of course. You can watch these two as a double feature for sure. Or you just skip the latter because honestly ""Abominable"" is pretty much superior in almost every department, especially the looks and behavior of the Yeti. (I also liked the Himalayas sign idea in the city early on.) Also the comedy. There are some pretty funny moments here. I mentioned the berry scene and the slow motion moments there already, but there is more, such as the granny talking about how her granddaughter should not be only as small as her daughter while she is really tiny herself, just one moment that stayed in the mind. Or several scenes involving the little chubby boy, even if he only sticks out of the Yeti's mouth with his lower body. That is already funny enough to watch as simple as it may be. There are at least a dozen other moments that will put a smile on your lips, even if it also needs to be said on a more negative note that there were many jokes and comedic inclusions that did come a bit short too, just like the one involving the head of security guy's fear that he could get fired and the ""who tells Mr. Burnish"" running gag got a bit dry quickly too. But then again, there are also these moments when the one character not only loses his coat, but also his pants and that was as brief as it was awkwardly funny, so I say well done again. Really nice attention to detail for those scenes that do nothing for the story. Sometimes the comedy is pretty American, sometimes not American at all, so you can also see the mix of countries involed with this move on this very occasion. I mean aside from the environmental message (and maybe that selfies are still evil), there is no great significance to the film except stories on friendship perhaps, but there doesn't need to be really. The film is definitely a success without these too and apart from that I really liked how they used the environmental message with making it seem significant, but not really constantly shoving it into our faces in the most self-important manner. It was rather Burnish's change in perception that made it obvious. I am a bit curious how this film will fare with awards bodies come awards season. Now it definitely won't be shut out at the Annies or so I'm sure despite its foreign involvement, but I wonder if it maybe can even get in at the Oscars too. I guess everything behind Toy Story 4 (and probably Frozen 2) seems really wide open at this point. But lets not talk about these two films that will get a gigantic deal of attention anyway and they surely deserve it, but stay with Abominable for now. This one gets a thumbs-up from me. A pretty delightful 95 minutes that deserve to be seen by adults and small ones alike. Don't miss out. Here we have another DreamWorks success, but not a triumph, and I probably have zero intention for a rewatch in the coming years, but if they ever make a sequel I'd watch.",4-Oct-19,Horst_In_Translation,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3914439/?ref_=tt_urv,10る6ら,1

Dreamworks is no Pixar or Disney. Dreamworks in its own words remains a dream. The filmographies that comes under its banner is a mixed bag of feelings for me. And if those mixed feelings have subjects like ineffective procedure bad mouthing the film, the idea is always something you could rely upon. At least it used to come under the ""what if"" list and provokes an interesting debate in the bar. But this time, even that idea is rotten. Outdated, to be honest. And not outdated like years or decades ago, but recently.
We've had such topics rubbed on our faces multiple times by these banners as an excuse of either rediscovering a world or humanizing a new creature or ten other topics that would make them animate adorable faces for us to swoon over them. And as far as ""cuteness"", as the kid says these days, is concerned there is no holding back. Even someone evil voiced by Sarah Paulson is given a curly red hair and big glasses to be easy on the eyes. But this is as far as the animation goes. It is colored too innocent and too pretty to balance the world with something dirty.
And there comes a pivotal point where it has to choose and spoil its hands. It goes without saying that the opportunity is missed embarrassingly. The other reason why the texture doesn't feel realistic or animated is the detailing. And you can see that quite clearly when it comes to wide shots and the world that it shows that looks like is drawn by a four year old kid. As mentioned, beautiful, cute, and colorful. Abominable never had any chance to be beyond a kid's show, something how they define it, although I wouldn't.",2-Oct-19,Arth_Joshi,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68112294/?ref_=tt_urv,,1

,Family Restoring Enlightenment,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5196902/?ref_=tt_urv,"*SPOILERS* Although I'm not a monk or anything I do believe Buddhism can be beneficial and the buddha is featured in this film. Yet what is this movie? An ancestral right of passage, helping out the powerful spirits of nature. Though this technically is a mainstream movie I didn't feel like it was, it's not every day you see Asians in films and being someone who eats rice I did appreciate it. That's another thing about this movie, food. There's soda to appeal to the movie goer and then pork to go eat with your loving family. A Vajrayana Buddhist book I read some of states that pork is the beginning stage of ignorance, so as this movie had many enlightening parts in between. It could be said in the end it takes us back to the lowest or what is also considered the Goddess in Buddhism. Although I threw a way the book because I stated having visions and dreams of vampires. Was in an obscure version of Buddhism, perhaps but it is said to be a lineage from Tibet it's self where the Himalayas are located. Which is another poignant aspect of this film or the main goal. I thought in general the yeti was supposed to represent a buddhist monk either that or the girls father because at the end he hands her the picture of her dad. Yeah I mainly saw this movie because the girl looked similar to a punk rock girl I was intimate with. Love em and leave em, or hold tight well past the love is gone.

,Interesting but some things are off,https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5173532/?ref_=tt_urv,"At first I didn't think I would like this film. The main character was very standoffish and unrelatable. At 17 years old, she's a weird case as she cared more about herself than having friends or spending time with her family. Most people her age and in fact, any human craves socialization. I understand her situation and she did have some character growth but still. I mean, the film is just a sweet film with a positive message about connecting with friends and family. Yi's cousins, Jin and Peng also started off as annoying comic relief bubbly teenagers but their actions are subdued as they interact with Yi and Everest. The only characters that didn't really grow on me were probably the mom and the grandma, as they didn't have much to them other than worrying about Yi. I don't blame them as they're not in the film much. The best and only solid character out of this was Everest, he's adorable, huggable, and magical. But overall, the character interactions, growth and the theme is where the film succeeds at the most.
But why do I still rate the film as a whole this low? Well, for starters, I didn't like the story. It was the same story of someone who meets a creature whom she forms an unlikely bond with and goes on a journey to send him home. The dialogue can be awkward at times and I can't remember laughing at more than a few jokes. A lot of the jokes just came off as effortless.
There were a couple moments in the film that I felt stood out, like the blueberry one, the Jin screaming as he travels one, and the Buddha one. Even though I didn't understand how Yi's violin was suddenly able to create magic, I did like the subtext of her grief with Coldplay's Fix You, the rain, the statue looking like he was crying, and Yi finally shedding a tear, this all makes it a beautifully emotional moment.
Abominable gets a 5.9/10. It may not be great, but it's a cute film to watch with your kids.",9-Oct-19,pinkarray,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39696525/?ref_=tt_urv,10る6ら,1

The bad guys just want to make money off of Everest
One scene where they change the aspect ratio and it lasts like 2 seconds but it doesn't make sense
Movie made to play in China as it takes place in China with Chinese lore and characters, cash grab in that sense

,"It's harmless for children, but Abominable feels similar to other DreamWorks movies",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5158993/?ref_=tt_urv,"Deep within the mountains of the Himalayas lies a mysterious creature called a yeti or an abominable snowman...wait a minute, didn't I talk about this before. When I put those together with the words ""animated movie"", your either going to bring up Smallfoot or Missing link, which had also talked about yetis. To be fair, a lot of similar ideas have been made into movies so it's not fair to discredit today's movie because of that. I can only assume that by the time Smallfoot was released, this was already halfway done, so they just had to go with what they had.
The big difference this time around are a couple of things. First, this is a collaboration between DreamWorks Animation and a Chinese company Pearl. Second, the story this time puts the focus on the humans rather then the monster. And finally, rather then making the yeti a walking, taking humanoid-type thing, this abominable snowman is more like a lovable dog that has magical powers. And honestly, because we always need family movies, families are probably not going to care about similar kinds of movies released, as kids can have something new. So let's see what Abominable has to offer.
In Shanghai, teenager Yi (played by Chloe Bennet) spends he days in Shanghai working odd jobs so that she can go travel and see more of China and perhaps the world. At the cost of her determination, she tends to avoid spending time with her mother and grandmother who are concerned that she's kept herself closed off since her father passed away. Though they think she's no longer interested in playing the violin, in secret she only plays alone. But a like a lot of stories involving monsters, she hears and finds a large animal on her roof, but sees not only is it not dangerous, but it's on the run from somebody.
She figures out that the monster is a child yeti that she calls Everest. That also because she sees that's him home and he needs help. They make it to a tanker, but also bring a long her friends Peng (played by Albert Tsai) and Jin (played by Tenzing Trainor). They make it to a jungle only to see the people looking for the yeti have caught up. These people are a wealthy explorer Burnish (played by Eddie Izzard) and zoologist Dr. Zara (played by Sarah Paulson). It's a race to see if they can get the yeti home while making some friends.
If you can tell, Abominable follows the formula to a lot of DreamWorks animated movies that deal with opposite outcasts on journeys. Shrek did it, Kung Fu Panda did it, and How to Train Your Dragon did it. Does this bring anything new to the formula? Not a lot. Because the formula is really repeated. The villains don't understand the heroes, the hero has a popular friend whose going to see things their way, and even the monster has a mystical power. It even lacks the emotion that it's trying to pull off.
Perhaps if this came out in the early 2000's, this would have been more original and unique. But for what it is, it seems kind of tired. It's a shame because the movie does have two good things going for it. First is the animation. DreamWorks has remained a competitor of Disney for a while for a reason; the style is really good. You not only feel and see the emotion through all the characters, but you get that feeling from the yeti who doesn't even talk.
The other thing it has going for it is the voice acting. It's nothing amazing, but every actor seems to be giving their all.
At best, this may appeal to kids who simply want to have a fun little adventure, but there isn't much for adults. Sure, there may be a funny joke occasionally and there's even a beautiful scene or two (I did love them playing the violin close to a large statue and flying on a giant dandelion), but it only makes you wish they had thought more outside the box. As is, its at least harmless and it's short.
I'll give this five yetis out of ten. This is far from a bad movie, but it's also not that unique. It feels like a movie that was thought up quickly and the storytellers did their job enough to make it work. As I said, kids will like it fine, though I think I'd rather show them Smallfoot or Missing Link. At least with those, I'm going on a different adventure then Abominable.",3-Oct-19,RforFilm,https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv,10る5ら,1

,"Solid, but forgettable and generic film.",https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5154948/?ref_=tt_urv,"A very fun and easy movie to watch that is very generic. Borrows many of the same storylines such as E.T. without doing anything too different.
It is extremely predictable and follows a very easy structure. The film does have a ton of charm, sweetness and a ton of cuteness of the yeti, Everest. It does have some great positive messages for kids. There is a bunch of wacky and over the top action scenes that I thought were enjoyable and creative. I do wish there was more of it in the film.
Overall, it was a solid okay film that is really generic and forgettable, but it wins me over because of its charm, humor at times and over the top action scenes. Wouldn't recommend to see unless with a small child.
